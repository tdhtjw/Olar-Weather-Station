# SC State University 1890 Research and Extension Olar-Weather-Station (Close to Bamberg, SC 29843)
This repository shares the information on the metadata of the weather station, and sampling rate, and provides readers with request access to weather station data.<br> 
The variables measured by the weather station and their respective units.<br> 
BattV=Volts (Battery voltage level); Sampled every 5 seconds.<br>
PTemp_C=Deg C; Sampled every 5 seconds.<br>
SlrMJ=MJ/m^2 (Total solar radiation measured using Pyranometer) Calculated based on the SlrW and scan rate.<br> 
DewPtC=Deg C (Dew point temperature) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
BP_mbar=mbar (Barometric pressure) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged for every 15 minutes.<br>
WS_ms=meters/second (Wind speed) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged for every 15 minutes.<br>
WindDir=degrees (Wind direction).<br>
AirTC=Deg C (Air temperature) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged every 15 minutes.<br>
RH=% (Relative Humidity) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged every 15 minutes.<br>
Rain_mm=mm (Rain) Measured every 5 seconds and totaled for every 15 minutes.<br>
VWC=m^3/m^3 (Volumetric water content) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
EC=dS/m (Electric conductivity) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
T=Deg C (Temperature from the soil moisture sensor) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
P=unitless (Permittivity) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
PA=nSec (Signal travel time) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
VR=unitless Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>

CS320_Temp=Deg C (Temperature measured by the Pyranometer) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>
CS320_Angle=degrees (Solar radiation angle) Scanned every minute and averaged over 15 minutes.<br>

The current version of the program running in Datalogger is shared for you to look at.<br>
The dashboard for Olar Weather station is available at this link: https://app.konectgds.com/kiosk/a44bb94a-6d20-4d53-bd09-520fc1a1c628 <br>
The dashboard gets updated every 60 minutes and is open for the public to view. <br>
The information on the sensors installed and their respective manuals are also available for you to look over. <br>
The weather station product manual folder description contains the list of all the sensors used for reference.<br>
